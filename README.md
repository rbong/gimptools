gimptools
=========

In the future, this will have multiple scripts I have found useful to write for
gimp. For now, it features one; a tool that can cycle throught the alien colour
filter to create pulsating colour images.


installation
============

Move the .scm files to your gimp scripts directory, then invoke them with
```
gimp -i -b '(command args)' -b '(gimp-quit 0)'
```
as specified in the script's comment section.
